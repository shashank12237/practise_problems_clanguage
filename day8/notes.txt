1) while , for ==> entry controlled loops 
2) do-while ==> exit controlled loops 
General form of switch statement is
•Switch ( expression)
  statement

•Switch selection expression must be of integral type

•Case labeled constituting the body of switch should be unique 
   i.e. no two case labels should evaluate to same value
case constants cannot be duplicated

•Decision or Selection
   •if-else
   •switch-case
•Iteration (loop)
    •for
    •while
   •do-while
•Jump
    •break
    •continue
   •goto
   •return

•Every loop has
    Initialization statement
    Terminating condition
   Modification statement(Increment/Decrement)
   Body of loop

•The variable that is used for terminating condition is referred as „loop variable‟. 

Infinite loop
  •If loop condition is always true, program never terminates.
